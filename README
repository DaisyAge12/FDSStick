This is a new method of installing an FDSStick into a Sharp Twin Famicom
Rather than having to cut the plastic card cover or have an ugly wire hanging around, this mod gives you a nice professional looking install while maintaining 
all benefits of the original installation method.

How to Install

1. Start by printing the Modded Cover and FDS snap cover

2. While that prints (roughly 3 hours) gather materials from the BOM

3. Refer to screenshots for proper installation of the JST connector and header pins
