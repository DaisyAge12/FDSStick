This is a new method of installing an FDSStick into a Sharp Twin Famicom
Rather than having to cut the plastic card cover or have an ugly wire hanging around, this mod gives you a nice professional looking install while maintaining 
all benefits of the original installation method.

How to Install

1. Start by printing the Modded Cover and FDS snap cover

2. While that prints (roughly 3 hours) gather materials from the BOM

3. Refer to screenshots for proper installation of the JST connector and header pins

4. Use sandpaper, a dremel, or a hot knife to remove the bump from the connector. Note if using a hot knife - pay attention! That's how mine came out so marred.

5. Remove locking back for SNES AV and insert it into the FDS snap cover (orientation is not important)

6. Assemble the XHP-12 connector cable as shown in pictures - do not insert a jumper into pin 12 of the white connector!

7. Remove the jumper ends and use wire strippers to remove the sheath

8. Run the wires throught the opening in the modded Twin Famicom cover

9. Install the wires according to this diagram from 3DS Capture's site:

Note: It is CRUCIAL that you double check your work as one wrong connection can make your FDS Stick short circuit

Note: See how I put my SNES connector upside down? Not only does it hide the ugly parts, it is also my guide so that I know which pins are being soldered to
      The goal is to have the FDS Stick facing up so you can easily press the button for flipping disks
